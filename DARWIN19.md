## Additional Notes

### Collaborative Key Generation

[This  CMVP document](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp4390.pdf) makes several refernces as to the nature of the CKG implementation.

Note-worthy tidbits from this document are in the Sensitive Security Parameter Managemnet section:
- 'Key Generation (ANSI X9.31) (CKG using method in Sections 4 and 5.1 [SP 800-133])'
- ECDSA Key Pair : 'The key pairs are generated conformant to SP800-133r2 (CKG) using FIPS186-4 Key Generation method, and the random value used in the key generation is generated using SP800-90A DRBG'
- RSA Key Pair : 'The key pairs are generated conformant to SP800-133r2 (CKG) using FIPS186-4 Key Generation method, and the random value used in the key generation is generated using SP800-90A DRBG'

Key / SSP generation:
-  'The module generates Keys and SSPs in accordance with FIPS 140-3 IG D.H. The cryptographic module performs Cryptographic Key Generation (CKG) for asymmetric keys as per [SP800-133r2] sections 4 and 5.1 (vendor affirmed), compliant with [FIPS186-4], and using DRBG compliant with [SP800-90A]. A seed (i.e., the random value) used in asymmetric key generation is a direct output from [SP800-90A] DRBG. The key generation service for RSA, ECDSA, as well as the [SP 800-90A] DRBG have been ACVT tested with algorithm certificates found in Table 4.'
