# PureDarwin Core Cryptography Library

This repository contains the `corecrypto` kernel-mode cryptography
library, as used in Andromeda/PureDarwin. At a later date, it will also
contain `libcorecrypto`, the user-mode equivalent thereof.

Despite the similar name, this library is **not** based on the released
source bundle for Appleâ€™s corecrypto implementation, because that code
is not licensed for re-use. This library is based on the
[botan](https://github.com/randombit/botan) and [LibTomCrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt/) libraries, as well as the
[pdcrypto](https://github.com/rafirafi/pdcrypto) code
